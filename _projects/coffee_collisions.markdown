<p>Collide for a (virtual) coffee with another Snowmass participant to build a new connection. We'll find you someone to talk to, so you can just think about the future of particle physics!</p>

<p>Participants will be matched based on shared interests, but across career stages, institutes and collaborations.</p>

<p><h2>The first round of collisions are currently taking place!</h2></p>

<p><h3>In case you need inspiration, maybe try using some of our conversation prompts:</h3></p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>"What proposed future facilities are you most excited about?"</i></li>
		<li><i>"What's it like to work at your institute/facility?"</i></li>
		<li><i>"What questions do you hope we answer in the next 40 years?"</i></li>
		<li><i>"Are you involved in any outreach projects?"</i></li>
		<li><i>"What was the last paper you read?"</i></li>
		<li><i>"Do you think the coffee at FNAL or CERN is better?</i></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>We'd like to hear from you after your collision!
